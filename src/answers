1. By making use of an example from the above scenario, distinguish between a class and an instantiation of a class.	[3]
In this scenario, a class may be SalesPerson, while an instance of the class would be a variable that is of that class,
in this case a specific person, such as "Dan Jones"

2. By giving two examples, explain how the principles of inheritance can be incorporated into the design of this administration program.[4]
You can have an employee class inherit into different employee types. You can also have a branch of the company inherit from the company.

3. Describe how the use of libraries can facilitate the development of programs like this company's administration program.[3]
You can have a separate library for each of its programs.

5. Complete the constructor public SalesPerson (String id),from the SalesPerson class.
public SalesPerson(String id) {
        this.id = id;
        salesHistory = new Sales[0];
        count = 0;
}

6. Explain why accessor methods are necessary for the SalesPerson class.
Since the instance variables are private, you need accessor methods to access them.

7. Construct unified modelling language (UML) diagrams to clearly show the relationship between the SalesPerson and sales classes.
Note: There is no need to include mutator or accessor methods or a constructor.	[4]

8. Outline a negative effect that a future change in the design of the sales object might have on this suite of programs.	[2]
It might cause dataloss.

9. State the output after running this code.	[4]
102; 2

10. Construct the method calcTotalSales ( ) , in the Sales Person class that
calculates the total value of the sales for a specific SalesPerson object.	[5]

11. By making use of any previously written methods, construct the method highest ( ) , that returns the ID of the salesperson whose sales have the largest total value.	[5]

12. Construct the method addSales (Sales s, String id) , in the Main class,
that will add a new Sales object s, to the salesperson with a specified ID.
Note: You can assume that the ID is a valid one.	[4]

13. Suggest changes that must be made to the salesperson class and/or the Sales class to allow these calculations to be made.	[3]
To allow the payroll class to
You need to make changes to implement the Payroll class. Change the SalesPerson class from an array of Sales to an array of Sales for each month

14. Discuss the use of polymorphism that occurs in this suite of programs.	[3]
The SalesPerson class takes multiple inputs to create a SalesPerson.
